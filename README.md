# HN Unread Comments

## What is it?
A simple Google Chrome extension that display unread comments on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com "Hacker News").

## How to use it?
Download and install the extension from the [Google Chrome extensions page](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fpndmkcfggkffpablcooicmihgcgalil "HN Unread Comments").

## Roadmap
I'm planning on adding the following features to the next (v2.0) release:

* options page where you can choose how unread comments are marked
* don't mark comments as unread when first viewing a item
* mark edited comments with a different style (configurable)
* do some cleanup so that the extension won't store data for old items (say more than a month)
